Because of their laser-sharp focus on helping users get the most out of what you read, Readwise asked me to help them optimize their design to best acommodate that vision."

I worked to de-clutter the experience of the highlight view by introducing a stronger visual hierarchy, lifting the highlight from the rest of the page and putting it front and center. Action colors were dimmed so as to not steal focus from the highlight.",
        "We created a product experience where the platform was secondary to the highlight. Bookmarking, note taking and sharing were all there when needed, but as small distractions as possible when notâ€”rendering the user with complete silence to engage with their highlight."
